Evil Henchman Sam Hanson is the man responsible for the housebot switches not being able to be turned off by fighting robots. Watch Sam stay totally chill when Business Cat returned to our last event, Round 7 in October, with Slam Plan, and turned his attention on FLOOP after he had taken out his opponent. \n\n#nhrl #engineering #robotics #robotfight #fightingrobots #combatrobotics #cashprize #gaming",

    "VideoDescription": "It\u2019s almost time; 2024 season World Championships are live this weekend, Saturday 7 December from 9am. Over the last few weeks, we have taken a look back at our season so far, and the bots that have qualified for World Championships. Last time out, Round 7 in October, we had a spooktacular event, where even our housebots were in costume. There was a lot going on, with a pumpkin armed with a flamethrower going up the costumed housebots, not one but four Pawsitively Hisstericals\u2019 facing off against a flamethrowing cow, and a cameo from Pasquale, much to host Lindsay\u2019s delight - or was it distress? Here\u2019s the list of the bots that qualified in Round 7:\n\n3LB\nTurboFIEND from Dima \nSupreme Ruler from Jeffrey Waters\nMonkfish from Rachel deGuzman\nIMPAKT from Lars Elliott\n\n12LB\nSLAM PLAN from Brendan Stele \nMinor Threat 5 from Derek Tran\nDoppelgator from Brooks Silber\nSon of Kram from David Small\n\n30LB\nWarhard XXL from Jonathan Juarez \nBeeForce from Zoe Lambert\nPegasus from Davi Parreira\nMister Roper from Spiff Refusee\n\n#nhrl #robotbattle #robotics #robotfight #engineering #gaming #robotfighting #worldchampionship",

    "VideoDescription": "Our Round 6 event in September had so many epic fight highlights, it\u2019s hard to choose just one. However, the strategic decision by the overall 3lb winner, Knuckle Sandwich, to turn their multibot into a projectile and launch it at Spitfire, a drone armed with a cannon, is up there with the best of them. The other qualifiers from the event, who also brought us some epic fight action and we can\u2019t wait to see back at World Championships on Saturday 7 December, are: \n\n3LB\nKnuckle Sandwich from Dess \nMako from Julian Papasian\nDimachaerus from Beckett\nSilent Spring from Jamison Go\n\n12LB\nBuzzzz-Kill from Liam King\nHooligan from Jack Sopotnick\nCreature from Caleb Hecht\nMaximizer from Jake Hoffmann\n\n30LB\nYahoo from Chad New\nHurricane from Tom Brewster\nSynthesis 30 from Corey Nason\nRed Storm from Kevin Milczewski\n\n#nhrl #robotbattle #robotics #robotfight #engineering #gaming #robotfighting #worldchampionship",

Luckily, at our last event we were prepared with Daisy, a flamethrowing cow, that stopped these automated felines in their track. We are keeping our eye on Paws, this season we have had a giant Paws, and now with replicating Paws, it\u2019s a matter of time before they really do find a way to take over NHRL! \n\n\n#nhrl #robotfight #robotics #robotbattle #fightingrobots #zombie #cats #3dprinting #weapons",
